        - Clone your Repo using githubs 'Clone or download' button,  Back inside your CLI, use the cd command to go to the directory where you are going to want to clone your forked Repo (i.e. The location where the repo should be saved on your computer), Use the git clone <link-to-repo> command to clone the repo to the directory you are currently in, Use the git clone <link-to-repo> command to clone the repo to the directory you are currently in, Use the git checkout -b 'firstname-lastname' command to create your own branch name for the repo (this is the branch that you will be doing your work on), Now you can work on your repo and start getting the project assignment done.  To add and commit changes on your branch you can do the following:git add, git commit, then push back changes into github repo, complete pull request.
